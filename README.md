This repo is part of a [video and written tutorial](https://code.lengstorf.com/learn-trellis-wordpress-roots/) that walks through using [Trellis](https://roots.io/trellis/) to quickly set up WordPress sites for both local development and deployment to staging and/or production servers, complete with:

- free SSL certificates from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org)
- better security thanks to [Bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock/)
- a simpler development workflow for single developers and teams alike
